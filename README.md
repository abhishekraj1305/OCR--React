# OCR--React
A system that extracts data from bills using Python (OCR, OpenCV) and displays it on a React-Vite dashboard. Features include automated data processing, CSV export, and a modern, interactive UI.

Bill Analysis System with Python Backend and React Dashboard
This project is a robust Bill Analysis System designed to extract, process, and present key information from scanned bills or invoices in a structured table format. It combines the power of Python for backend OCR processing with a dynamic React-based dashboard for intuitive data visualization and management.

Key Features:
OCR-Powered Data Extraction: Utilizes Python's pytesseract library and advanced preprocessing techniques (OpenCV and PIL) to enhance image clarity and extract text with high accuracy.
Data Structuring: Automatically organizes extracted information into structured formats, identifying fields like invoice numbers, delivery dates, contact information, and more.
React Dashboard: Built using ReactJS with the Vite build tool for a fast, modern, and responsive user interface to display and manage processed data.
Real-Time Insights: Users can review, edit, and download analyzed data in CSV format, enabling seamless integration with existing workflows.
Image Preprocessing: Incorporates advanced preprocessing methods such as adaptive thresholding, contrast enhancement, and noise reduction to improve OCR accuracy.
Scalable and Extensible: Backend API endpoints enable easy integration with additional front-end features or third-party services.
Technology Stack:
Backend: Python, Flask/FastAPI for API development, Tesseract OCR, OpenCV, and PIL for image processing.
Frontend: ReactJS with Vite for a high-performance and interactive dashboard.
Data Management: CSV export functionality for structured data storage and retrieval.
Use Case:
This system is ideal for automating the digitization and analysis of bills and invoices in industries such as logistics, retail, and supply chain management, enhancing productivity and reducing manual errors.
